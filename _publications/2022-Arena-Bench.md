In-memory computing techniques are used to accelerate artificial neural network (ANN) training and inference tasks. Memory technology and architectural innovations allow efficient matrix–vector multiplications, gradient calculations, and updates to network weights. However, on-chip learning for edge devices is quite challenging due to the frequent updates. Here, we propose using an analog and temporary on-chip memory (ATOM) cell with controllable retention timescales for implementing the weights of an on-chip training task. Measurement results for Read–Write timescales are presented for an ATOM cell fabricated in GlobalFoundries’ 45 nm RFSOI technology. The effect of limited retention and its variability is evaluated for training a fully connected neural network with a variable number of layers for the MNIST hand-written digit recognition task. Our studies show that weight decay due to temporary memory can have benefits equivalent to regularization. We also show that the controllability of the decay timescale can be further advantageous. This strongly suggests the utility of temporary memory during learning before on-chip non-volatile memories can take over for the storage and inference tasks using the neural network weights. We thus propose an algorithm-circuit codesign in the form of temporary analog memory for high-performing on-chip learning of ANNs.
